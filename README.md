# FTB Donation Form

An accessible WordPress donation plugin built with a strong focus on WCAG 2.2, usability, and maintainability.

**Live demo:** [GitHub Pages](https://websitebezorgd.github.io/ftb-donation-form/)

---

## Goal

Build a professional donation plugin for WordPress with:

- Accessible (WCAG 2.2) frontend form
- Mollie payment integration
- Flexible admin configuration
- Clean and maintainable codebase

---

## Development approach

This plugin is built from scratch to maintain full overview and control. Each phase is completed and tested before the next one starts.

---

## Implementation phases

| # | Phase | Description | Status |
|---|-------|-------------|--------|
| 1 | Plugin base | Main plugin file, activation hook, DB table, shortcode | ✅ Done |
| 2 | Static form | Accessible HTML/CSS/JS form + GitHub Pages demo | ✅ Done |
| 3 | WordPress integration | Shortcode rendering + asset enqueue | ✅ Done |
| 4 | Validation | Client-side (JS) + server-side (PHP) + nonces | ✅ Done |
| 5 | Admin settings | API key, form options, fields, privacy, post-payment | ✅ Done |
| 6 | Mollie integration | Payment flow + webhook status updates | 🔲 Todo |
| 7 | Dashboard | Donation records overview with search, filters, pagination | ✅ Done |
| 8 | Translations | i18n + `.pot` file + WPML / TranslatePress compatibility | 🔲 Todo |
| 9 | Testing | Accessibility + validation (throughout all phases) | 🔄 Ongoing |
| 10 | Security | Nonces, sanitization, escaping, capability checks | ✅ Done |

## Current status

Phases 1–5, 7, and 10 are complete. The form collects and stores donations, all admin settings are configurable, and submitted donations appear in the WordPress dashboard.

**Next up:** Mollie payment integration — creating payments and handling webhook callbacks to update payment status.

---

## Features

### Frontend form
- Multi-step form (donation details → personal details)
- One-time, monthly, and yearly frequency options (recurring can be toggled off in settings)
- Up to three fixed amount options + optional custom amount with configurable minimum
- Optional fields: phone number, street, house number, postal code, city
- GDPR consent checkbox with link to privacy statement
- Client-side and server-side validation with accessible error summary
- Full keyboard navigation, screen reader support, WCAG 2.2

### Admin settings
- **Mollie:** API key + test mode toggle
- **Titel:** customisable form heading
- **Frequentie:** enable/disable recurring payments — includes a reminder to activate SEPA Direct Debit in Mollie
- **Bedragopties:** up to three fixed amounts + custom amount toggle + configurable minimum
- **Formuliervelden:** optional field toggles (phone, address fields)
- **Privacyverklaring:** privacy statement URL — includes an AVG/GDPR reminder when left empty
- **Na betaling:** show a thank-you message or redirect to a page

### Donation dashboard
- All submitted donations listed with: name, email, phone, address, amount, frequency, status, date
- Sortable columns, search box, and status filter tabs (all / pending / paid / failed / cancelled)
- Payment status badges

### Security
- Nonces on every form submission
- All input sanitised, all output escaped
- Capability checks (`ftb_manage_settings`) on every admin page
- Prepared statements for all database queries

## Shortcode

```
[ftb_donation_form]
```

Optionally override the title:

```
[ftb_donation_form title="Steun ons"]
```

---

## Accessibility

Accessibility is a core requirement, not an afterthought:

- Semantic HTML (`fieldset`, `legend`, associated labels)
- Full keyboard support and visible focus indicators
- Screen reader support (tested with NVDA and Windows Narrator)
- Error summary with focus management on validation failure
- `aria-invalid`, `aria-required`, `aria-current` throughout
- WCAG 2.2 guidelines

---

## Phase completion rules

A phase is only complete when:

- Code is understandable without AI
- Accessibility is tested (keyboard + screen reader)
- No console errors
- No obvious security issues

---

## Mollie integration (phase 6)

What needs to be built to make payments work:

1. **Mollie PHP SDK** — installed via Composer, or bundled manually in the plugin
2. **Create a payment** — when the form submits successfully, call Mollie's API to create a payment and redirect the donor to Mollie's checkout page
3. **Webhook endpoint** — a WordPress REST API route that Mollie calls when a payment status changes; this updates the record in `wp_ftb_donations`
4. **Return URL** — after payment Mollie sends the donor back to the site; the plugin shows the thank-you message or redirects based on the admin setting
5. **Recurring payments** — for monthly/yearly, Mollie uses mandates (SEPA Direct Debit); the first payment creates the mandate, subsequent ones are charged automatically via the Mollie API

The database layer (`FTB_DB`) and the `mollie_payment_id` / `payment_status` columns are already in place — the groundwork is done.

---

## WordPress plugin repository

Requirements to get accepted on wordpress.org:

1. **License** — `GPL-2.0-or-later` declared in the main plugin header and a `LICENSE` file
2. **Readme.txt** — a separate `readme.txt` in wordpress.org format (different from `README.md`), with `Tested up to`, `Requires at least`, `Stable tag`, and a changelog
3. **No external calls without disclosure** — bundling the Mollie SDK or documenting the API call is required
4. **No minified JS without source** — source JS files must be included in the package
5. **Translation-ready** — a `.pot` file in `/languages` and all strings wrapped in `__()` / `esc_html_e()` (already done)
6. **Sanitize / escape / nonce** — already done, but reviewers check this strictly
7. **Prefixed everything** — all functions, classes, and options use `ftb_` (already done)
8. **No bundled Composer autoloader with dev dependencies** — only production dependencies in the plugin package

Outstanding before submitting: `readme.txt`, `LICENSE` file, and a cleanly bundled Mollie SDK.

## Notes

- Focus is on understanding and maintainability, not speed
- Each phase is tested before the next begins
- Complex features (like payments) are added only after the basics are solid
